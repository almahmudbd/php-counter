# PHP User Counter

An easy-to-use PHP counter that requires **NO SQL database** and is safe from ad blockers' anti-tracking measures.

This is a classic method for tracking user visits, often seen in mobile FTP scripts like **cm79ftp**.

## How to Use

Place this file in a public folder, and include it on the pages where you'd like to track user visits.

``<? include"count.php"; ?>``
