# PHP User Counter

This is an easy-to-use PHP counter that requires NO SQL database or External Scripts, and it was safe from ad blockers' anti-tracking measures. 
it's a classic method for tracking user visits, often seen in MobileFTP/WapFTP scripts like **cm79ftp**.

## How to Use

Place this file in a public folder, and include it on the pages where you'd like to track user visits.

``<? include"count.php"; ?>``
